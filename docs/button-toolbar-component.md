The button-toolbar component, prefixed by gds-button-toolbar, is used to combine multiple button-groups into a cohesive toolbar.

**Note:** By using HTML comments in between 'display:inline-block' elements as in the example code below, the default spacing between the elements is eliminated and they render directly adjacent to each other.
