The `gds-balloon` component is meant to be used to display contextual information when rolling over or clicking some other element. It is, in essence, a more robust and flexible version of a tooltip complete with formatting for titles and descriptions instead of just a simple string of text. While it has built in elements for title and description, it can contain any formatted HTML.

Use the position modifiers `gds-balloon--left`, `gds-balloon--right`, `gds-balloon--top`, & `gds-balloon--bottom` to make the arrow position correctly with respect to the balloon and the corresponding element being highlighted.
