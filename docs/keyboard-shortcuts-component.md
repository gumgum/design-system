The keyboard shortcuts component, prefixed by `gds-keyboard-shortcuts`, is used to display currently available keyboard shortcuts. This component is hidden by default. To show the component, add `gds-keyboard-shortcuts--shown` to `gds-keyboard-shortcuts`.

This component should always include a "Don't show again" button that can be used to permanently hide the component from view by the current user. This setting should be toggle-able from the user's profile or settings page.
