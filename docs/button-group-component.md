The button-group component, prefixed by `gds-button-group`, is used for arranging button components into a group. For a toolbar made up of multiple button-groups, see the [gds-button-toolbar](button-toolbar-component.md) component documentation.

**Note:** By using HTML comments in between 'display: inline-block' elements as in the example code below, the default spacing between the elements is eliminated and they render directly adjacent to each other.
