The image component, prefixed by `gds-image`, is used to style `<img>` tags. Note: `<img>` tags should always include an `alt=""` attribute with a brief description of the image's content.

To include a label element after the `gds-image`, use the `gds-image__label` class.

<img
    class="gds-image"

    alt="Girl with Coca-Cola logo placeholder"
/>
