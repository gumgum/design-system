## DO NOT USE - WILL BE DEPRECATED

The ranker ensign component, prefixed by `gds-ranker-ensign`, is used to represent a brand, team, person, etc that holds a specific rank. It will generally be used in conjunction with a ranker grid and or a leaderboard component to show how a specific set of items ranks against one another.
