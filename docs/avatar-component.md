The avatar component, prefixed by `gds-avatar`, can display a user's photo, a brand's logo, or a flag icon for internationalization. The avatar can include a dropdown menu, which is meant to be shown when the avatar is clicked on. To show the dropdown menu, add the `gds-avatar--menu-open` class to `gds-avatar`. As with bubble menu and filter components, the button that invokes the avatar menu should contain a `gds-bubble-button` attribute with a value that points at some form of selector for the menu it corresponds to.
