The `gds-legend` component is used to display the name, color, and potentially the value of data sets. It is generally meant to be paired with a chart or graph although other use cases may arise. Color values for each data set should be assigned via data attributes that correspond to predefined DS colors - including 4 levels of tint and shade for each color Other modifiers change the positioning and orientation of items, sizing, and the shape of color swatches.
