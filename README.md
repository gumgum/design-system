---

As part of the GumGum 2020 rebranding, this design system will be begin to be updated to match the new brand styles. Concrete is inspired by the GumGum Santa Monica office with crisp architectural lines and modern exposed concrete.

### Upcoming Changes:

- Design System will become open source
- New NPM Package
- Simplified UI inventory & build process
- Better documentation, examples, and templates

### What to expect:

Updates to this design system will be rolled out into small stages to help reduce breaking UI on our existing platforms. Each release will included expectations on breaking changes along with solutions. Our goal is to fit these simple changes into each teams sprint release.

The existing design system will continue to be maintained to stable, but will soon be phased out.

For now there will be no CDN available to this design system since most of our applications are running off React and using node-sass.
